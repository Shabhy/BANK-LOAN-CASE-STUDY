# BANK-LOAN-CASE-STUDY
The objective of this case study is to
provide practical insight into the
application of Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) within a genuine business
context. Through this study, weâ€™'ll not
only implement EDA techniques covered
in the module but also gain fundamental
insights into risk analytics within the
banking and financial sectors. By delving
into this analysis, we'll grasp how data is
effectively utilized to mitigate the risk
associated with lending to customers,
ultimately safeguarding against
potential financial losses.
